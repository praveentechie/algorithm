/**
 * Tries are an ordered tree-like data structure efficient in handling programming problems related to "strings".
 * - A trie is always a set of linked nodes with an empty root node.
 * - Each node represents a unique alphabet.
 * - Each node can point to null or other children nodes.
 * - Tries to provide the same path for words that share a common prefix.
 * 
 * Pros:
 *  - Trieâ€™s retrieval/insertion time in the worst case is better than hashTable and binary search trees.
 *  - It is easy to print all words in alphabetical order
 * Cons:
 *  - They require a lot of memory storage for strings.
 *  - More complex than other data structures
